🚂 Week 2: Express.js – Server-Side Framework
🚀 Objective

Build a RESTful API using Express.js that implements standard CRUD operations, proper routing, middleware functionality, error handling, and advanced features like filtering, pagination, and statistics.

📂 Tasks
🧩 Task 1: Express.js Setup

Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y


Install Express.js and dependencies:

npm install express


Create a basic Express server that listens on port 3000.

Implement a "Hello World" route at the root endpoint (/).

🧱 Task 2: RESTful API Routes

Created a resource called products with the following fields:

Field	Type	Description
id	Number	Unique identifier
name	String	Product name
description	String	Product description
price	Number	Product price
category	String	Product category
inStock	Boolean	Product availability
Implemented Routes:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Get all products
GET	/api/products/:id	Get a specific product by ID
POST	/api/products	Create a new product
PUT	/api/products/:id	Update an existing product
DELETE	/api/products/:id	Delete a product
⚙️ Task 3: Middleware Implementation
✅ Logger Middleware

Logs the request method, URL, and timestamp for every incoming request.

✅ JSON Parser

Uses express.json() to parse JSON request bodies.

✅ Authentication Middleware

Checks for a valid API key in the request header (x-api-key) before allowing access.

✅ Validation Middleware

Ensures required fields (name, description, price, category) are provided during product creation or update.

⚠️ Task 4: Error Handling
🧰 Implemented Features:

Global Error Handler: Catches all application errors and sends structured JSON responses.

Custom Error Classes:

AppError – Base error class

NotFoundError – Missing resource errors

ValidationError – Invalid input data

UnauthorizedError – Authentication failures

Asynchronous Error Handling: Managed using try/catch blocks and a reusable async wrapper function.

Example Error Response:
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Product not found"
}

⚡ Task 5: Advanced Features
Feature	Description	Example
Filtering	Filter products by category	/api/products?category=Food
Pagination	Paginate product list using page & limit	/api/products?page=1&limit=2
Search	Search products by name	/api/products?name=honey
Statistics	Get total product count by category	/api/products/stats/data
🧪 Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, you should have:

A fully functional Express.js API with CRUD operations.

Cleanly structured middleware for logging, authentication, and validation.

Centralized error handling with meaningful status codes.

Extended features for filtering, pagination, and analytics.

🛠️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure Node.js (v18 or higher) is installed:

node -v
npm -v

2️⃣ Project Initialization

Clone or create your project folder and navigate to it:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd express-api


Initialize Node.js:

npm init -y


Install dependencies:

npm install express

3️⃣ Project Structure
express-api/
│
├── server.js       # Main application entry
├── routes.js       # Handles all product routes
├── models.js       # Product model and data functions
├── config.js       # Configuration file (port, API key)
└── README.md       # Documentation

4️⃣ Configuration (config.js)

Example:

const config = {
  PORT: 3000,
  API_KEY: '12345'
};
module.exports = config;

5️⃣ Running the Server

Start your Express server:

node server.js


You should see:

🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000

📡 API Documentation
🔹 Base URL
http://localhost:3000/api/products

🔸 Headers
x-api-key: 12345
Content-Type: application/json

🔸 Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Example Request	Example Response
GET	/api/products	Get all products	/api/products	[ { "id": 1, "name": "Honey Jar" }, ... ]
GET	/api/products/:id	Get product by ID	/api/products/1	{ "id": 1, "name": "Honey Jar" }
POST	/api/products	Create new product	{ "name": "Candle", "description": "Beeswax candle", "price": 10, "category": "Home", "inStock": true }	{ "id": 173420...", "name": "Candle" }
PUT	/api/products/:id	Update existing product	{ "price": 12 }	{ "id": 1, "price": 12 }
DELETE	/api/products/:id	Delete product	/api/products/1	{ "message": "Product deleted successfully" }
GET	/api/products?category=Food	Filter by category	/api/products?category=Food	[ { "name": "Honey Jar" } ]
GET	/api/products?name=honey	Search products by name	/api/products?name=honey	[ { "name": "Honey Comb" } ]
GET	/api/products?page=1&limit=2	Paginate results	/api/products?page=1&limit=2	[ { "name": "Honey Jar" }, { "name": "Beeswax Candle" } ]
GET	/api/products/stats/data	Product statistics	/api/products/stats/data	{ "Food": 2, "Home": 1, "Health": 2 }
⚙️ Example Usage (via curl)
GET all products
curl -H "x-api-key: 12345" http://localhost:3000/api/products

POST new product
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: 12345" \
  -d '{"name":"Honey Comb","description":"Raw honey comb","price":20,"category":"Food","inStock":true}'

GET product statistics
curl -H "x-api-key: 12345" http://localhost:3000/api/products/stats/data

🧰 .env.example

(For future use if you decide to use environment variables)

PORT=3000
API_KEY=12345
